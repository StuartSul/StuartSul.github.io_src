title: Work-Rest Interval Timer
summary: A simple timer to keep your eyes healthy
description:
  - So after years of programming, my eyes became really dry and I was quite concerned about my eyes.
  - After consulting an ophthalmologist, I was suggested to always take a 10-minute break after 50 minutes of screen work.
  - So I made this timer to keep that rule as I work. Super useful.
