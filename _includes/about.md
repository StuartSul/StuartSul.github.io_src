Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by the amazing [**Chris RÃ©**](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/) in the [Hazy Research](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) lab and supported by the Kwanjeong Scholarship. I am also a part-time Research Scientist at [**Cursor**](https://www.cursor.com/).
 
My research focuses on **ML systems**. I design hardware-aware abstractions and methods to accelerate training and inference of large language models. Some of my work includes [megakernels](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-05-27-no-bubbles), [efficient MXFP8 training](https://cursor.com/blog/kernels), [GPU networking](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-09-22-pgl), and [ThunderKittens](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens).

Previous to Stanford and Cursor, I co-founded [**Blux**](https://blux.ai/), an AI startup specializing in empowering Korean e-commerce through AI-driven personalization. Blux raised $3M+ and is personalizing over 10 million Korean users' online journeys monthly.

In addition, I am an electric guitarist and composer. I have released two albums and performed as lead guitarist and producer for multiple rock bands since 2008.

# Experience

## Research Scientist @ Cursor (Anysphere Inc.)
#### June 2025 - Present | San Francisco, CA

Building in-house models and optimizing AI kernels for large-scale training and inference. Check out my [recent blog post on MXFP8 MoE kernels](https://cursor.com/blog/kernels).

## Research Assistant @ Stanford AI Lab
#### December 2024 - Present | Stanford, CA

Working with Prof. Chris RÃ© at [Hazy Research](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/). Working on [ThunderKittens](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens), [megakernels](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-05-27-no-bubbles), and [GPU networking](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-09-22-pgl).

## Co-Founder and CTO @ Blux
#### July 2021 - August 2023 | Seoul, South Korea

Blux provides real-time recommender systems for e-commerce. Blux raised $3M+ and is personalizing over 10 million Korean users' online journeys monthly.

I was the only technical co-founder until we acquired our first paying customer. I built everything (server, infrastructure, ML) from scratch. Over time, I recruited and led a team of 15+ engineers.

## Research Assistant @ Seoul National University
#### June 2020 - September 2020 | Architecture and Code Optimization Lab

Worked with Prof. Jae W. Lee to design and implement a novel embedding clustering algorithm in C++, reducing main memory access by up to 44% in commercial deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs). This research resulted in a paper accepted at ASPLOS 2021.

## Research Assistant @ Seoul National University
#### December 2019 - February 2020 | Music and Audio Research Group

Worked with Prof. Kyogu Lee on audio processing architecture using CNN, cGAN, super-resolution, and the Griffin-Lim algorithm for commercial singing voice synthesis. Also performed millisecond-precision data labeling on audio and MIDI data using Logic Pro and Python for 30+ K-pop songs.

## Sergeant, Combat Medic @ US Army
#### November 2017 - August 2019 | Dongducheon, South Korea

Served as a Combat Medic (68W) in a U.S. Army cavalry unit for 21 months through the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army (KATUSA) program, fulfilling South Korea's mandatory military service requirement.
