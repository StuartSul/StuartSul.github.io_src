                <li>So after years of programming, my eyes became really dry and I was quite concerned about my eyes.</li>
                <li>After consulting an ophthalmologist, I was suggested to always take a 10-minute break after 50 minutes of screen work.</li>
                <li>So I made this timer to keep that rule as I work. Super useful.</li>
