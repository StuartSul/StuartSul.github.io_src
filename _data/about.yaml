      I served as a Combat Medic in a U.S. Army cavalry unit from November 2017 to August 
      2019 (21 months). This was possible through the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army 
      (KATUSA) program, which allowed me to fulfill South Korea's military service 
      requirement while serving in the U.S. Army.
