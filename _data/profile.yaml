    Hi there üëã, I'm Stuart.
    </br></br>
    I aim to be both an entrepreneur and a dedicated computer engineer. I'm passionate about developing new products, optimizing complex systems, learning new technologies, and building a great team. I love the feeling of tackling novel challenges from scratch and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer science.
    </br></br>
    I co-founded Blux (formerly Z.Ai), an AI startup specializing in empowering e-commerce and online content platforms through AI-driven personalization. Blux raised $1.7M+ USD from SpringCamp and Primer Sazze, and personalized over 10 million Korean users' online journeys monthly. Leading Blux was an exciting journey building robust and scalable ML systems and dedicating myself to effectively leading and growing our engineering team.
    </br></br>
    I briefly worked as the DevOps & MLOps Lead at Linq (Techstars '23), focusing on developing efficient software architectures for operating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) products designed for professional services firms. 
    </br></br>
    I am now pursuing my Master of Science degree in Computer Science (MSCS) at Stanford University.
    </br></br>
    In addition, I'm a guitarist, sound engineer, and composer with two publicly released albums. I've been a lead guitarist and producer in various rock bands since 2008. I'm always up for a conversation about rock music and audio.
