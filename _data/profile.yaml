    Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Stuart.
    </br></br>
    I aim to be both an entrepreneur and a dedicated computer engineer. I develop new products, optimize computer systems, and build teams. I truly love the feeling of tackling new challenges from scratch.
    </br></br>
    I co-founded Blux (formerly Z.Ai), an AI startup specializing in empowering e-commerce and online content platforms through AI-driven personalization. Blux raised $1.7M+ USD from SpringCamp and Primer Sazze, and personalized over 10 million Korean users' online journeys monthly.
    </br></br>
    I am now pursuing my Master of Science degree in Computer Science at Stanford University. I'm currently focusing on MLSys research @ <a class="link-trans" href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/" itemprop="sameAs" target="_blank"><u>Hazy Research</u></a> (Prof. Chris RÃ©). 
    </br></br>
    In addition, I professionally play electric guitar and compose music. I have released two albums and have been the lead guitarist and producer for various rock bands since 2008.
