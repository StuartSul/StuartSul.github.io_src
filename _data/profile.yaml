    Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Stuart.
    </br></br>
    I aim to be both an entrepreneur and a dedicated engineer. I develop new things, optimize systems, and build teams. I truly love the feeling of tackling new challenges from scratch.
    </br></br>
    I co-founded <a class="link-trans" href="https://blux.ai/" itemprop="sameAs" target="_blank"><u>Blux</u></a> (formerly Z.Ai), an AI startup specializing in empowering Korean e-commerce through AI-driven personalization. Blux raised $3M+ and is personalizing over 10 million Korean users' online journeys monthly.
    </br></br>
    I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Stanford University. I'm focusing on MLSys research @ <a class="link-trans" href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/" itemprop="sameAs" target="_blank"><u>Hazy Research</u></a> (Prof. Chris RÃ©), contributing to the <u><a class="link-trans" href=https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens>ThunderKittens</a></u> project.
    </br></br>
    I also work on machine learning research @ <a class="link-trans" href="https://www.cursor.com/" itemprop="sameAs" target="_blank"><u>Cursor</u></a>, accelerating in-house AI training and inference through optimized kernel development.
    </br></br>
    In addition, I professionally play electric guitar and compose music. I have released two albums and have been the lead guitarist and producer for various rock bands since 2008.
